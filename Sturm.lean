# Sturm's theorem (real-root counting via the signed remainder sequence)

Reverse-engine target (2026-06-15): confirmed ABSENT from Mathlib (Lean 4 has `signVariations`
of coefficients / Descartes' rule of signs, but NOT the Sturm sequence nor Sturm's theorem).
Already formalized in Coq (Cohen), Isabelle/HOL (Li–Paulson, Sturm–Tarski) and HOL Light, so this
is **first in Lean**, not first in any ITP. Genuine Mathlib gap, our exact domain (real-root
counting), PR-able.

This file is **P0 of the plan**: the two missing definitions + the main statement (with `sorry`).
The real work (P1–P5: chain algebra, local constancy, root crossing, assembly) lands incrementally.

## Definitions
* `Sturm.sturmSeq p` — the signed remainder sequence `p, p', -(p % p'), …` of `p : ℝ[X]`.
* `Sturm.signVarAt L x` — number of sign changes in the list `L` **evaluated** at `x` (zeros
  dropped), the eval-analogue of `Polynomial.signVariations` (which is on coefficients).

## Main statement
* `Sturm.sturm` — for squarefree `p` and `a < b` neither a root of `p`,
  `signVarAt (sturmSeq p) a - signVarAt (sturmSeq p) b` equals the number of DISTINCT real roots
  of `p` in `(a, b]`.

/-! ## P1 — chain algebra

The signed-remainder step `next = -(a % b)` obeys `a + next = b * (a / b)`. Evaluated at a root of
the middle member `b`, this forces `a(x) = -next(x)`: the predecessor and successor are antipodal
there. With consecutive members coprime (squarefree case), neither vanishes, so they have strictly
opposite signs — the engine that makes interior sign-variation changes cancel. -/

/-! ## P2 — local constancy

On an interval where a polynomial has no root its evaluation keeps a constant sign (IVT: an opposite
sign at the endpoints would force a root in between). Hence on an interval free of roots of EVERY
chain member, the whole sign pattern — and therefore `signVarAt` — is constant. -/

/-! ## P3 — behaviour at a root of `p` (analytic core)

At a simple root `α` of `p` (so `p'(α) ≠ 0`), write `p = (X - α)·g`; then `g(α) = p'(α) ≠ 0`, and
near `α`, `sign(p(x)) = sign(x - α)·sign(p'(α))`: `p` flips sign, with orientation fixed by `p'`.
This is the analytic engine behind "the leading pair `(p, p')` loses exactly one sign variation as
`x` crosses `α`". The remaining combinatorial accounting (full V-drop over the list) is P3'/P5. -/

/-! ## P3' — sign-variation combinatorics (toward the V-drop)

Factor `signVarAt` through a pure `signChanges : List SignType → ℕ` and prove the bookkeeping
facts the V-drop needs: zeros are invisible, and a three-term window with opposite nonzero ends
always shows exactly one variation regardless of its middle (the interior-root cancellation from
P1's antipodal property, in combinatorial form). -/
