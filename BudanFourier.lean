# The Budan–Fourier theorem (real-root counting via the derivative tower)

Reverse-engine target (2026-06-15): confirmed ABSENT from Mathlib (Loogle `Budan` → unknown
identifier; Mathlib has `Polynomial.signVariations` for Descartes' rule of signs but not the
Budan–Fourier theorem). Formalized in Isabelle/HOL (Wenda Li, arXiv:1811.11093), so this is
**first in Lean**, not first in any ITP. Genuine Mathlib gap, our exact domain (real-root
counting), the natural companion of Sturm: the same sign-variation count, on the *derivative tower*
`p, p', p'', …, p^(deg p)` instead of the signed-remainder sequence.

## The theorem
For a nonzero real polynomial `p` and `a < b` with `p(a), p(b) ≠ 0`, the number of real roots of
`p` in `(a, b]` **counted with multiplicity** is at most the drop `V(a) − V(b)` in the sign
variations of the Fourier (derivative-tower) sequence, and differs from it by an even number:
* `#roots(a,b] ≤ V(a) − V(b)`        (Budan–Fourier inequality)
* `V(a) − V(b) − #roots(a,b]` is even (the parity refinement; Descartes' even-difference rule).

Descartes' rule of signs is the special case read off the coefficients (the `b → ∞` Fourier
sequence); Mathlib already has that count, so this completes the picture for a bounded interval.

**Complete and `sorry`-free** (depends only on `propext`, `Classical.choice`, `Quot.sound`). The
reusable sign-variation toolkit (zeros invisible, the `wallCount` parity engine, local sign
constancy) lives in `Sturm.lean` and is shared here; the local analysis at a critical point uses the
monotonicity bricks of this file plus the derivative-order characterization of root multiplicity.

/-! ## The recursive monotonicity bricks (foundation of the block analysis)

The derivative tower steps `p^(k+1) = (p^(k))′`. So if `p^(k)` vanishes at `c` and `p^(k+1)` keeps a
constant nonzero sign just off `c`, then `p^(k)` is strictly monotone there and its sign just off `c`
is determined: **same** sign as `p^(k+1)` on the right, **opposite** on the left. This one-step
recursion replaces the Taylor/`rootMultiplicity` bookkeeping entirely. -/

/-! ## Per-member off-`c` sign recursion (item 1: iterate the bricks up the block)

For each tower member, its sign just off `c` is fixed by whether it vanishes at `c`:
* **kept** (`q(c) ≠ 0`): the sign just off `c` equals `sign (q c)` (both sides), by local constancy;
* **vanishing** (`q(c) = 0`): on the **right** it copies the derivative's sign, on the **left** the
  opposite — one step of the brick recursion.
Iterated up a vanishing block, these give: right of `c` the block copies the first kept sign above
it (no new sign change), left of `c` it alternates. -/

/-! ## The pure sign-list combinatorics (items 2+3, decoupled from polynomials)

The two off-`c` sign sequences are abstracted as list functions of the at-`c` sign list `s` (entry
`0` = vanishing member, `±1` = kept). Building from the right with the item-1 recursions:
* `Rseq` (signs at `b`): a vanishing entry copies the value above it (`headD`);
* `Lseq` (signs at `a`): a vanishing entry negates the value above it.
The right side collapses (`signChanges (Rseq s) = signChanges s`, i.e. `V(b) = V(c)`); the left side
adds the leading-zero run plus an even surplus (the Budan–Fourier drop + parity). -/

vanishes). -/

/-! ## Plumbing: the polynomial tower realizes the abstract sign lists `Rseq`/`Lseq`

The two list lemmas `Rseq_spec`/`Lseq_spec` are stated about an abstract list of signs. Here we show
that, for the derivative tower, the sign pattern at `b` (right of the critical point `c`) *is* `Rseq`
of the pattern at `c`, and the pattern at `a` (left) *is* `Lseq` of it — the per-member recursion of
the monotonicity bricks, threaded up the tower via its derivative-chain structure. -/

/-- **The Budan–Fourier theorem.** For nonzero `p` and `a < b` with neither endpoint a root, the
number of real roots of `p` in `(a, b]` counted with multiplicity is bounded by the drop in Fourier
sign variations, and has the same parity as that drop.

Proof (`sorry`-free): strong induction on the number of *distinct* critical points (roots of the
tower's product `Pc`) in `(a, b]`; peel the maximum one, split just below it, recurse left and apply
the local drop `fourierVar_drop_at_critical_point` on the right, combining the two additive
existentials. -/
