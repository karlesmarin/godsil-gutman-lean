# The Path-Tree Program — Godsil–Gutman & Heilmann–Lieb in Lean 4

A machine-checked formalization, in **Lean 4 / Mathlib**, of classical results
about the **matching polynomial** of a graph and the road between them, in a series of
papers:

- **Paper I — *Random Signs into Matchings*** ([`godsil-gutman-lean.pdf`](godsil-gutman-lean.pdf)):
  the **Godsil–Gutman identity** — the average characteristic polynomial of a
  uniformly random `±1` signing of a graph is its **matching polynomial** — plus
  the first formalization of the matching polynomial and its deletion recurrence in
  any proof assistant, and the Bilu–Linial 2-lift decomposition.
- **Paper II — *Unfolding a Graph into a Tree*** ([`heilmann-lieb-lean.pdf`](heilmann-lieb-lean.pdf)):
  the **Heilmann–Lieb theorem** — `μ_G` is real-rooted, and for maximum degree
  `Δ ≥ 2` all its roots lie in the Ramanujan band `[−2√(Δ−1), 2√(Δ−1)]` — proved
  via Godsil's path tree, the divisibility `μ_G ∣ μ_{T(G,u)}`, the forest identity,
  and a weighted Gershgorin / Collatz–Wielandt argument.
- **Paper III — *Walks that Forget the Cycles*** ([`path-tree-walks-lean.pdf`](path-tree-walks-lean.pdf)):
  the **bijection** between the **tree-like walks** of a graph and the walks on Godsil's
  path tree (`card_treeLike_eq_pathTreeWalks`) — the *combinatorial half* of Godsil's
  **moment theorem** `p_k = Σ_i θ_i^k = treeLikeWalkCount` — together with the spectral
  form `treeLikeWalkCount = Σ_v [A(T(G,v))^k]_root` and the forest bridge `μ(T)=charpoly`.
  The same path tree of Paper II, taught to count walks. The spectral half (single-entry
  resolvent + univariate Newton) is **mapped, not built**; `sorry`-free, three standard axioms.

A companion strand formalizes the **Ihara side** of spectral graph theory:

- **Bass's determinant formula** ([`Ihara/Bass.lean`](Ihara/Bass.lean)): the
  **Ihara–Bass identity** `(1−u²)^|V| · det(I − uB) = (1−u²)^|E| · det(I − uA + u²(D−I))`,
  relating the non-backtracking (Hashimoto) operator `B` of a graph to its adjacency
  and degree matrices — the reciprocal of the Ihara zeta function. To our knowledge
  the **first machine-checked proof of Bass's formula in any proof assistant**. Proved
  over a field (the standard setting) via the orientation reindex
  `Dart ≃ Bool × {positive darts}`, `det(I + uJ) = (1−u²)^|E|`, and a Sylvester
  (Weinstein–Aronszajn) step. This is the natural counterpart to the matching
  polynomial: matching poly = the "tree/Plancherel" side, Ihara–Bass = the
  "cycle/π₁" side of the graph trace formula.

Each paper has an English and a Spanish edition (`*-es.pdf`). All headline theorems
are **`sorry`-free**: `#print axioms` reports only `propext`, `Classical.choice`,
`Quot.sound`.

> new theorem and claims none. The "first formalization" claim is supported by a

## What is formalized

All theorems below are `sorry`-free (axioms: `propext`, `Classical.choice`,
`Quot.sound`).

### Paper I — Godsil–Gutman

| Lean name | Statement | File |
|---|---|---|
| `godsil_gutman` | `∑_cfg det(xI − A_cfg) = #cfg · μ_G` | `MSS/GodsilGutman.lean` |
| `matchingPoly` (+ infra) | `μ_G = ∑_k (−1)^k m_k x^{n−2k}` — first in any prover | `MatchingPoly.lean` |
| `matchingNumber_recurrence` | `m_{k+1}(G) = m_{k+1}(G−v) + ∑_{u∼v} m_k(G−v−u)` | `MatchingPoly.lean` |
| `charpoly_twoLift` | Bilu–Linial 2-lift charpoly factorization | `MSS/TwoLift.lean` |

### Paper II — Heilmann–Lieb (the path-tree route)

| Lean name | Statement | File |
|---|---|---|
| `matchingPoly_realRooted` | `μ_G` is real-rooted, every finite `G` | `MSS/ForestRealRooted.lean` |
| `matchingPoly_bounded` | roots of `μ_G` in `[−2√(Δ−1), 2√(Δ−1)]` (`2 ≤ Δ`, `deg ≤ Δ`) | `MSS/HeilmannLiebBound.lean` |
| `connected_matchingPoly_dvd_pathTree` | `μ_G ∣ μ_{T(G,u)}` (Godsil divisibility) | `MSS/ForestComponents.lean` |
| `matchingPoly_forest_eq_charpoly` | `μ_F = charpoly(A_F)` on a forest | `MSS/ForestRealRooted.lean` |
| `pathTree_isAcyclic` | the path tree `T(G,u)` is a forest | `MSS/PathTree.lean` |
| `collatzWielandt` | weighted Gershgorin eigenvalue bound | `MSS/HeilmannLiebBound.lean` |
| `forest_bounded_proof` | forest matching roots in the band | `MSS/HeilmannLiebBound.lean` |
| `forest_adj_dist_pm_one`, `forest_le_one_parent` | the two tree-distance facts | `MSS/HeilmannLiebBound.lean` |

The **full Heilmann–Lieb theorem** (both halves) is now machine-checked; what
Paper I listed as "future, mapped" is done. Still future: the
interlacing-families existence step and the signing/2-lift correspondence that
would yield a formalized proof that Ramanujan graphs exist (Paper II, Q1).

### Paper III — the path tree counts walks

The combinatorial half of Godsil's **moment theorem** `p_k = Σ_i θ_i^k = treeLikeWalkCount`.

| Lean name | Statement | File |
|---|---|---|
| `card_treeLike_eq_pathTreeWalks` | `#{tree-like walks of G at v} = #{walks at root of T(G,v)}` (the bijection) | `Ihara/MomentBridge.lean` |
| `treeLikeWalkCount_eq_sum_pathTree_adjMatrix_pow` | `treeLikeWalkCount G k = ∑_v [A(T(G,v))^k]_root` | `Ihara/MomentBridge.lean` |
| `matchingPoly_pathTree_eq_charpoly` | `μ(T(G,v)) = charpoly(A(T(G,v)))` (forest) | `Ihara/MomentBridge.lean` |
| `pathTreeProj_walk_injective`, `exists_root_lift` | the bijection's injective + surjective halves | `Ihara/MomentBridge.lean` |
| `liftSeq_map_invariant` | the `liftSeq`↔path-tree-vertex invariant | `Ihara/MomentBridge.lean` |
| `Walk.isTreeLike_of_acyclic` | acyclic edge-support ⇒ tree-like (path-tree definition) | `Ihara/PathTree.lean` |

The **spectral half** (single-entry resolvent `[A(T)^k]_root = ` coeff of `μ(T−root)/μ(T)`,
plus the univariate Newton step to `p_k`) is **mapped, not built**; the matrix-resolvent
infrastructure (`resolventSeries`, `coeff_resolventSeries`) is already in `Ihara/TraceFormula.lean`.

### The Ihara side — Bass's determinant formula

`sorry`-free over a field (`#print axioms` = `propext`, `Classical.choice`,
`Quot.sound`).

| Lean name | Statement | File |
|---|---|---|
| `bass_determinant` | `(1−u²)^\|V\| · det(I − uB) = (1−u²)^\|E\| · det(I − uA + u²(D−I))` | `Ihara/Bass.lean` |
| `det_one_add_smul_reversal` | `det(I + uJ) = (1−u²)^\|E\|` (J = dart reversal) | `Ihara/Bass.lean` |
| `dartEquiv` | orientation reindex `Dart ≃ Bool × {positive darts}` | `Ihara/Bass.lean` |
| `hashimoto_eq` | `B = Tᵀ S − J` (non-backtracking operator) | `Ihara/Bass.lean` |
| `card_posDart` | `\|{positive darts}\| = \|E\|` | `Ihara/Bass.lean` |

`B` is Hashimoto's non-backtracking edge operator on the `2\|E\|` darts; `A`, `D`
the adjacency and degree matrices; `J` the reversal involution. The field
hypothesis is the standard Bass setting (the Sylvester step inverts `I + uJ`,
a unit exactly when `1 − u² ≠ 0`); the degenerate value `u² = 1` is handled by
the no-edge / empty-graph cases. Full `CommRing` generality would follow by a
universal-coefficient transfer, not pursued here.

This is the **Ihara/π₁ side** complementing the matching polynomial (the
tree/Plancherel side). With both endpoints now in Lean, a future Part II can
formalize the **graph trace formula** that fuses them.
