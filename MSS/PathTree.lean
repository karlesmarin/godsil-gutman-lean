# The path tree `T(G, u)` (Godsil)

Godsil's **path tree** of a finite graph `G` rooted at a vertex `u`: its vertices are
the paths of `G` that start at `u`, and two paths are adjacent when one is obtained
from the other by appending a single edge at the end. The trivial path (just `u`) is
the root.

The path tree is the engine of Godsil's proof that the **matching polynomial is
real-rooted**: `μ(G) ∣ μ(T(G,u))`, and `T(G,u)` is a *forest*, so `μ(T(G,u))` is the
characteristic polynomial of a symmetric matrix — real-rooted — and the spectral
radius of a tree of max degree `Δ` is `≤ 2√(Δ−1)`. Combining: every root of `μ(G)`
is a root of `μ(T(G,u))`, hence real and inside the Ramanujan band `[−2√(Δ−1),
2√(Δ−1)]` (Heilmann–Lieb).

This file builds the **object** and proves it is genuinely a **forest** (`IsAcyclic`):
the divisibility `μ(G) ∣ μ(T(G,u))` and the spectral-radius bound are the next stones.

## Encoding

* Vertices: `PathFrom G u := Σ v, G.Path u v` — a path of `G` starting at `u`, paired
  with its (variable) endpoint.
* `Grows a b`: `b` is `a` with one edge appended at the end (`b = a.concat`).
* `pathTree G u`: the symmetrisation of `Grows`.

The **parent** of a non-root path is `Walk.dropLast` (drop the last vertex); appending
then dropping is the identity (`concat_dropLast`), and each step changes the length by
exactly one. These two facts make the path tree a forest.

I could find no prior formalization of Godsil's path tree in a proof assistant.

/-! ## The path tree is a forest -/

/-- **`T(G, u)` is acyclic — a forest.** Suppose a cycle existed. Rotate it to start
at a vertex `m` of **maximal** path-length in the cycle. Both cycle-neighbours of `m`
(its `snd` and `penultimate`) then have length `≤ m`, so — adjacency changing length by
exactly one — each has length `m − 1`, i.e. each *grows into* `m`. Hence each is a
**parent** of `m`; by `Grows.parent_unique` they coincide. But a cycle's second and
penultimate vertices are distinct (`IsCycle.snd_ne_penultimate`). Contradiction. So no
cycle exists, and the path tree is a forest — exactly what makes `μ(T(G,u))` the
characteristic polynomial of a symmetric matrix, hence real-rooted. -/

/-! ## Root decomposition `T(G,u) − r ≅ ⊔_{b∼u} T(G−u, b)` — the child embedding

Removing the root `r = (u)` from `T(G,u)` leaves, hanging from each child `(u,b)` (`b ∼ u`),
the subtree of paths through that edge. That subtree is `T(G−u, b)`: a path of `G` from `u`
with second vertex `b` is exactly `u` prepended to a path of `G−u` from `b` (`u` is never
revisited, so the tail lives in `G−u`). `prependRoot` is this injection; assembling it over
all `b ∼ u` (plus the isolated `r`) gives the decomposition, hence — via `matchingPoly_sum`
— `μ(T−r) = X·∏_{b∼u} μ(T(G−u,b))`, the product step of Godsil's divisibility. -/
