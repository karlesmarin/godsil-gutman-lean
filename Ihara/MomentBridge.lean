# Welding Godsil's path tree to tree-like walk counts — moment theorem, stone 1

Godsil's moment theorem `p_k = Σᵢ θᵢᵏ = treeLikeWalkCount G k` (the matching side of the
matching↔Ihara trace-formula bridge) routes through the **path tree** `T(G,v) = pathTree G v`
(`MSS/PathTree.lean`, built for the Heilmann–Lieb formalisation): the SAME forest that carries the
real spectrum of `μ(G)` also counts the closed tree-like walks of `G`.

The connection is the **down-projection** `π : T(G,v) →g G`, a path ↦ its endpoint. A closed walk
at the root of `T(G,v)` projects under `π` to a closed walk at `v` of `G`; because `T(G,v)` is a
forest, that projection lands exactly in the tree-like class (`Ihara/PathTree.lean`), and the lift
is unique — so the projection is a length-preserving bijection onto the tree-like walks. That
bijection turns `[A(T(G,v))ᵏ]_{root,root}` (a spectral quantity, via `μ(T−root)/μ(T)`) into
`treeLikeWalkCount`, which is Godsil's theorem.

This file lands the first stone: the projection hom and its basic properties. The bijection,
the resolvent identity `μ(G−v)/μ(G) = μ(T−root)/μ(T)`, and the Newton step are the remaining stones.

to its endpoint. Adjacency in the path tree means one path extends the other by a single edge, so
the two endpoints are adjacent in `G`; hence `π` is a graph homomorphism. This is the map along
which closed walks at the root of the (forest) path tree project to closed tree-like walks of `G`. -/

/-! ## Local injectivity of the projection (the path tree is an immersion of `G`)

The bijection "closed walks at the root of `T(G,v)` ↔ closed tree-like walks of `G` at `v`" is
realised by `Walk.map (pathTreeProj G v)`. Its injectivity rests on a purely local fact: `π` is
injective on the neighbours of *each* path-tree vertex `p`. The neighbours of `p` are its unique
parent (`dropLast`) and its children (one-edge extensions); `π` sends the parent to `p`'s penultimate
vertex (which lies on `p`) and each child to its fresh endpoint (which does not), and distinct
children have distinct endpoints — so the projection separates all neighbours of `p`. -/

/-- **Child uniqueness** (dual of `Grows.parent_unique`): a one-edge extension of `p` is determined
by its endpoint. If `a` and `a'` both grow from `p` and share an endpoint, they are equal. -/

/-- **`π` is injective on the neighbour set of each path-tree vertex** — the path tree is an
immersion of `G`. Parents coincide by `parent_unique`, children by `child_unique`; a child's
endpoint is fresh (`∉ p.support`) while a parent's endpoint is `p`'s penultimate (`∈ p.support`),
so the two families never collide. This local injectivity drives the walk-lift bijection. -/

/-- **`Walk.map π` is injective on walks of the path tree** (with fixed endpoints): a walk of the
forest `T(G,v)` is recovered from its `G`-projection. By induction, each step's next vertex is a
neighbour of the current one, and `π` separates neighbours (`pathTreeProj_injOn_neighborSet`), so the
lift is forced — the injective half of the stone-1 bijection. -/
