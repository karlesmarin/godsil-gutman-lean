# Welding Godsil's path tree to tree-like walk counts — moment theorem, stone 1

Godsil's moment theorem `p_k = Σᵢ θᵢᵏ = treeLikeWalkCount G k` (the matching side of the
matching↔Ihara trace-formula bridge) routes through the **path tree** `T(G,v) = pathTree G v`
(`MSS/PathTree.lean`, built for the Heilmann–Lieb formalisation): the SAME forest that carries the
real spectrum of `μ(G)` also counts the closed tree-like walks of `G`.

The connection is the **down-projection** `π : T(G,v) →g G`, a path ↦ its endpoint. A closed walk
at the root of `T(G,v)` projects under `π` to a closed walk at `v` of `G`; because `T(G,v)` is a
forest, that projection lands exactly in the tree-like class (`Ihara/PathTree.lean`), and the lift
is unique — so the projection is a length-preserving bijection onto the tree-like walks. That
bijection turns `[A(T(G,v))ᵏ]_{root,root}` (a spectral quantity, via `μ(T−root)/μ(T)`) into
`treeLikeWalkCount`, which is Godsil's theorem.

This file lands the first stone: the projection hom and its basic properties. The bijection,
the resolvent identity `μ(G−v)/μ(G) = μ(T−root)/μ(T)`, and the Newton step are the remaining stones.

/-! ## Local injectivity of the projection (the path tree is an immersion of `G`)

The bijection "closed walks at the root of `T(G,v)` ↔ closed tree-like walks of `G` at `v`" is
realised by `Walk.map (pathTreeProj G v)`. Its injectivity rests on a purely local fact: `π` is
injective on the neighbours of *each* path-tree vertex `p`. The neighbours of `p` are its unique
parent (`dropLast`) and its children (one-edge extensions); `π` sends the parent to `p`'s penultimate
vertex (which lies on `p`) and each child to its fresh endpoint (which does not), and distinct
children have distinct endpoints — so the projection separates all neighbours of `p`. -/

/-- **Child uniqueness** (dual of `Grows.parent_unique`): a one-edge extension of `p` is determined
by its endpoint. If `a` and `a'` both grow from `p` and share an endpoint, they are equal. -/

/-- **`π` is injective on the neighbour set of each path-tree vertex** — the path tree is an
immersion of `G`. Parents coincide by `parent_unique`, children by `child_unique`; a child's
endpoint is fresh (`∉ p.support`) while a parent's endpoint is `p`'s penultimate (`∈ p.support`),
so the two families never collide. This local injectivity drives the walk-lift bijection. -/

lift is forced — the injective half of the stone-1 bijection. -/

/-! ## The `liftSeq`↔path invariant (image is tree-like + surjectivity of the lift)

`liftSeq` (the intrinsic tree-like test of `Ihara/PathTree.lean`) run on a projected path-tree walk
tracks the current tree-vertex's path. One step in `T(G,v)` — `Grows s y` (extend) or `Grows y s`
(retreat to parent) — mirrors exactly one `liftSeq` step (EXTEND push / RETREAT pop). -/

/-- **One path-tree step = one `liftSeq` step.** Walking `T(G,v)` from `s` to a neighbour `y`,
feeding `liftSeq` the next projected vertex `y.1` with stack `s`'s path-support turns the stack into
`y`'s path-support: an EXTEND when `y` is a child of `s` (fresh endpoint, push) and a RETREAT when `y`
is its parent (endpoint = penultimate, pop). -/

/-! ## Surjectivity of the lift (the last half of the stone-1 bijection)

Conversely, a `G`-walk that `liftSeq` accepts from a current tree-vertex `⟨a, pp⟩` lifts to a path-tree
walk projecting back to it. The hypothesis `liftSeq w.support.tail pp.support = some t` supplies, at
each step, exactly the EXTEND (fresh vertex → child) or RETREAT (penultimate → parent) decision, so
the lift is built by recursion with no failure branch. -/

/-- **Existence of the lift.** If `liftSeq` accepts the `G`-walk `w : a ⟶ b` started from the path
`pp : v ⟶ a` (current tree-vertex `⟨a, pp⟩`), returning final stack `t`, then `w` lifts to a path-tree
walk `W` from `⟨a, pp⟩` to a vertex `q` with `q`'s path-support `= t` whose projection has the same
support as `w`. (Support equality dodges the dependent endpoint; `support_injective` upgrades it to
walk equality once the endpoints are pinned, in the closed-walk corollary.) -/

i.e. the path tree's root–root resolvent `charpoly(T−r)/charpoly(T)` equals the graph ratio
